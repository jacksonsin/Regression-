4.2 Lasso regression (RMSE: 0.19816522542866322 )
4.3 LassoCV (RMSE: 0.1602095580138513 )

# Train the model using Neural Networks
4.4 Neural Networks - 1 hidden layer (RMSE:0.1602095580138513 )
4.5 Neural Networks - 2 hidden layers (RMSE: 0.1602095580138513)
4.6 Neural Networks - 2 hidden layers, x2 hidden nodes (RMSE: 0.1602095580138513 )

# Build ensemble model
